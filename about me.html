    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1><font color="recording" size="4%"><b><p><i>
    Photography is my passion. When I had my son six years ago I bought my first DSLR and fell in love! <br>
    He changed every day and the best way to document these changes was to capture them in a photograph.<br>
    I haven’t put my camera down since and now I feel so honored to be photographing other families and <br>
    helping them document their own memories.<br>
    The most often used photo is that of your own headshot. It is simple and gives the client a glimpse <br>
    of who they will be working with. A good portrait to use is one where you are looking straight at the<br>
    camera. It would have a feeling that you are looking and communicating directly with your client. <br>
    It’s like you are already having a connection with them.<br>
